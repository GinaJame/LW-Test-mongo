# LW-Test-mongo
Homework for my web lab class where we use mocha and mongodb

# Run Test
This project uses Mocha for testing, and you can find all the tests in the test folder. 
To run the current test just type on terminal.

`npm test`

# Run project
## Install all the dependencies
`npm install`   
## Run on localhost
`npm start`    
Then go to [localhost](https://localhost:3000)
In this interface you can add, update, delete or get a bicycle.

You can find in this project the link to connect to Mongo, in other implementations is recommended to add a .env file where you should save your link to avoid having that info in your repo
